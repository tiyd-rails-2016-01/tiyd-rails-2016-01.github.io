## Welcome!

Welcome to the The Iron Yard in Durham!  Congratulations on being accepted, and for deciding to take on such an intense program.  The next three months will be exciting, exhausting, and empowering.  I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.

You're probably wondering what you're in for (or are at least wondering something about me), and while I can't answer all of your questions in this format, I think we'll cover a lot.  Your first task, though, is to:

* [Read the Syllabus](/syllabus/)

If you want to know some of the "why" of my teaching style, feel free to read [some broad, hand-wavy thoughts](/syllabus/values.html).  

The remainder of this site gets down to brass tacks.  Here you'll find references and resources for you to use before, during, and after the class. If I missed something, please let me know!

### Before

You'll need to complete all of these steps before August 24th.  If you have ANY questions at all, please reach out to me at mason.matthews@theironyard.com.

* [Get a Mac](/before/mac_specs.html)
* [Set up your Mac](/before/setup.html)
* [Sign up for accounts](/before/accounts.html)

* [Do the PREWORK](/before/exercises.html) - Complete this through the "Conclusion" survey by August 24th, one week before class begins.  This timing is both so that I can review and so that you can rest before class starts.
