## Durham Campus Final Projects

In Durham, we have designed our own final project approach, and have created this document to share its details with the entire company.

### Pitch Day

On Friday of week 9, we hold a "Pitch Day."  Each student is required to pitch an idea for two minutes, and then is asked questions by staff for up to two minutes.  During this time, other students cannot ask questions.

Although each student is required to pitch, they ARE allowed to pitch in pairs (so long as both partners speak).

At the end of the pitches, students can mingle and ask each other questions for half an hour.  Each student takes an colored index card (pink == Ruby, green == Python, etc), and they write down their top five choices (in order).  They are not required to vote for their own pitch if there are others they prefer, but if they do vote for their own, we ask them to circle their idea (for the staff's convenience).

### Selection Process

After the discussion, the staff collects all the index cards and goes offsite.  We match up groups, attempting to optimize the following criteria:

* We want to assign you to one of your first few choices.
* If you pitched with someone else and that group is picked (and you both voted for it), you will be together.
* We create groups of 3, 4, or 5 people.
* We try not to put together any groups that all come from the same course.
* We avoid known personality conflicts from earlier in the class.

Thus far, when students vote for five choices, we've never had a student who wasn't assigned to one of his/her choices.

After assigning groups, we then give two mentors to each group (typically instructors, but occasionally TAs or local professionals).  We also schedule the time of day for check-ins and stand-ups (see below) so that no mentor is double-booked for a particular time.

Students are given assignments on the afternoon of pitch day (Friday of week 9), and are instructed to focus on planning over the weekend.  We ask them to create workflow diagrams, ERDs, and Trello boards (see below) TOGETHER as an entire group.  They can only begin coding once the planning is complete.  Some will get to coding over the weekend, and some will not.

### The Schedule

When laying out the calendar for the final projects, we mark the following dates:

* Planning Check-in: Monday of week 10
* Sprint 1 Check-in: Thursday of week 10
* Sprint 2 Check-in: Monday of week 11
* Sprint 3 Check-in: Thursday of week 11
* Sprint 4 Check-in: Monday of week 12
* Feature freeze: Monday of week 12 (midnight that night)
* Code freeze: Wednesday of week 12 (midnight that night)
* Rehearsals: Wed/Thurs of week 12
* Demo Day: Thurs/Fri of week 12
* Graduation: Friday of week 12

Feature freeze means that students stop developing new features, and after that point, only fix bugs and work on design.  Code freeze is what it sounds like.  After that point, you should be working on your presentations, portfolios, and networking.  Feature freeze and code freeze are strong recommendations, but not enforced.  Students are adults, and can take their fates into their own hands if they choose.

### Mentoring/Trello Boards

Project mentors are primarily responsible for guiding students during check-ins (see below) and making sure that they create, adhere to, and update their project plan as necessary.

All groups are required to create two Trello boards.  The first board contains four columns: Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3, and Stretch.  These columns contain cards of user stories (of the form "[Role] can [action] so that [deeper goal]).  Even though the project has four sprints on the calendar, we know that features will slip, so we define the Sprint 1-3 features as the full set of what is needed to qualify as a completed final project.  In other words, some slipping is okay, but too much slipping is not.  Mentors have the responsibility of deciding whether or not a given set of features is "enough."

The second Trello board is the "Current Sprint" board, and it consists of three columns: To-do (initially populated from the other board), In Progress, and Completed.

### Check-ins

There are four standard check-ins over the course of the final project, and the first is different from the rest.

Between Pitch Day and the Monday of week 10, students must perform project planning as described above.  The first check-in is mainly meant to validate the project plan, both for user story quality and for feature quantity.  Commonly, students ignore the properties of a good user story and just write down everything that they can think of which they need to do.

At Durham, we make a big fuss out of internally consistent MVPs.  At each check-in, the application must be clean, have no known bugs, have no links or sections which do nothing, and accomplish something useful to the users.  In other words, they need to prioritize closure over having lots of features started.

All check-ins after the first have the following agenda:

* Students present their application as though it is Demo Day
* Mentors comment on presentation quality
* Mentors comment on functionality
* Mentors comment on style (this grows in importance as time passes)
* The group and its mentors rearrange the Trello boards for the next sprint

When students present, each student must speak.  Mentors time the presentations, then ask students to guess at how long it took.  This helps students start to calibrate to what 5 minutes look like.

Sometimes groups come to a check-in and they have not created an internally consistent MVP.  When it is just a few loose ends, this is not a problem.  However, when it is clear that many features have been started and not finished, next sprint planning may not be possible, so mentors may ask students to have a second check-in in 24 hours (during which no new features may be started).

### Daily Stand-ups

At the same time each day, groups are asked to hold stand-ups.  During these stand-ups, each person should talk for no more than 2 minutes, and the following three items should be covered:

* What you did yesterday
* What you are planning to do today
* What roadblocks you have

On non-check-in days, mentors typically attend the stand-ups.

### Trouble

Groups can get into trouble during final projects in a number of ways.  Sometimes, there are personality conflicts or major life events.  Those are difficult to plan for, and have to be handled on an individual basis.

Most commonly, though, groups get behind because of poor project management within the group, and this is the reason we provide such a rigorous final project structure.  That being said, there is still enough leeway for students to cause trouble for themselves.

This slippage can be evident at the check-in after sprint 1, but groups will often recover by the end of sprint 2.  By the end of sprint 3, though, it may be clear that the groups are well behind schedule, and features have to be cut.  At this point, mentors can take a number of different actions.  On one extreme, groups can be given ultimatums; if the group does not accomplish X, Y, and Z over the weekend, the group will not present.  It is also possible to tell the group that they will not have a full five minutes to present on Demo Day (if they have not created enough functionality to justify it).

The right course of action in these situations will depend on the culture of the campus.

### Demo Day

When planning the order of presentations for Demo Day, we spread the best projects out.  With a break in the middle, we typically put the best at the very end and right before the break.

Each group speaks for 5 minutes, and we leave no time for questions.  At the conclusion of the presentations, groups station themselves at tables (like in a science fair), and employers are free to visit any of the tables and ask whatever questions they have.
