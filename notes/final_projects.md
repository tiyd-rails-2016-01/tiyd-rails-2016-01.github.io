## Durham Campus Final Projects

In Durham, we have designed our own final project approach, and have created this document to share its details with the entire company.

### Pitch Day

On Friday of week 9, we hold a "Pitch Day."  Each student is required to pitch an idea for two minutes, and then is asked questions by staff for up to two minutes.  During this time, other students cannot ask questions.

Although each student is required to pitch, they ARE allowed to pitch in pairs (so long as both partners speak).

At the end of the pitches, students can mingle and ask each other questions for half an hour.  Each student takes an colored index card (pink == Ruby, green == Python, etc), and they write down their top five choices (in order).  They are not required to vote for their own pitch if there are others they prefer, but if they do vote for their own, we ask them to circle their idea (for the staff's convenience).

### Selection Process

After the discussion, the staff collects all the index cards and goes offsite.  We match up groups, attempting to optimize the following criteria:

* We want to assign you to one of your first few choices.
* If you pitched with someone else and that group is picked (and you both voted for it), you will be together.
* We create groups of 3, 4, or 5 people.
* We try not to put together any groups that all come from the same course.
* We avoid known personality conflicts from earlier in the class.

Thus far, when students vote for five choices, we've never had a student who wasn't assigned to one of his/her choices.

After assigning groups, we then give two mentors to each group (typically instructors, but occasionally TAs or local professionals).  We also schedule the time of day for check-ins and stand-ups (see below) so that no mentor is double-booked for a particular time.

### The Schedule

When laying out the calendar for the final projects, we mark the following dates:

* Planning Check-in: Monday of week 10
* Sprint 1 Check-in: Thursday of week 10
* Sprint 2 Check-in: Monday of week 11
* Sprint 3 Check-in: Thursday of week 11
* Sprint 4 Check-in: Monday of week 12
* Feature freeze: Monday of week 12 (midnight that night)
* Code freeze: Wednesday of week 12 (midnight that night)
* Rehearsals: Wed/Thurs of week 12
* Demo Day: Thurs/Fri of week 12
* Graduation: Friday of week 12

Feature freeze means that students stop developing new features, and after that point, only fix bugs and work on design.  Code freeze is what it sounds like.  After that point, you should be working on your presentations, portfolios, and networking.  Feature freeze and code freeze are strong recommendations, but not enforced.  Students are adults, and can take their fates into their own hands if they choose.

### Mentoring/Planning

Project mentors are primarily responsible for guiding students during check-ins (see below) and making sure that they create, adhere to, and update their project plan as necessary.

All groups are required to create two Trello boards.  The first board contains four columns: Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3, and Stretch.  These columns contain cards of user stories (of the form "[Role] can [action] so that [deeper goal]).  Even though the project has four sprints on the calendar, we know that features will slip, so we define the Sprint 1-3 features as the full set of what is needed to qualify as a completed final project.  In other words, some slipping is okay, but too much slipping is not.  Mentors have the responsibility of deciding whether or not a given set of features is "enough."

The second Trello board is the "Current Sprint" board, and it consists of three columns: To-do (initially populated from the other board), In Progress, and Completed.
