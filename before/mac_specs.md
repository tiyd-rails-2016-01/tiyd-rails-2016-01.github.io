## Get a Mac

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a
minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs,
but I REALLY recommend getting 8 GB of RAM.

Here are the current
[MacBook Air models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html) and
[MacBook Pro models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/).

Your MacBook MUST be running OS X Mavericks or Yosemite. Both are free
upgrades from the App Store.

There is no commercial software required for the class.
