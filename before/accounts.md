## Accounts You'll Need

Over the course of the class, we'll be using a number of online services.  We'll
set up a few of them for you, but these are the ones you'll need to register for
on your own. Please use the __same email address__ to register that you provided
to Jessica for our Iron Yard communications.

* [Github](https://github.com/) - Add a profile picture and your full name
* [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity)
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

You may have heard that we also use the following tools, but don't sign up for them yet; we'll do that once you get here:

* Teamwork
* Slack
* Trello
