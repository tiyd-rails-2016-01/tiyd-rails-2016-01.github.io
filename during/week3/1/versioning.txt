major.minor.micro

1.0.0 - First stable release.

1.0.1 - Fixed bugs.  Didn't add new features.  Your code which uses it will still work.

1.1.0 - Added new features. Method X still works the same way, but it might have a new method Y.

2.0.0 - Probably broke existing features. You called method X, it might not work the same way now, have the same parameters, return the same values, etc.

EXCEPT PRIVATE Methods - if you call them with .send(), all bets are off.  Any change could break your code.  DON'T DO IT.
