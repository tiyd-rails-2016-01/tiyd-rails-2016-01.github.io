# Interview Questions (that YOU can ask)

When going into an interview with a company, it's very important to have good questions you can ask of them.  It shows that you are interested in their work, and that you're seeking a job that's a good fit.  Both of those things make you more appealing as an employee.

The best questions are ones that drill into something unique to that company.  Try to find something that you want to know which isn't found on the company's website, but which is about their business or approach.  Once you've come up with a list of those, consider bringing some of the following questions as well.

One last comment: if you're interviewing with five people in a row, make sure that you ask EACH of them good questions.  "I've already asked all my questions" doesn't usually come across well.
