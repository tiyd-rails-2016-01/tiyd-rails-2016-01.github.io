# Interview Questions (that YOU can ask)

When going into an interview with a company, it's very important to have good questions you can ask of them.  It shows that you are interested in their work, and that you're seeking a job that's a good fit.  Both of those things make you more appealing as an employee.

The best questions are ones that drill into something unique to that company.  Try to find something that you want to know which isn't found on the company's website, but which is about their business or approach.  Once you've come up with a list of those, consider bringing some of the following questions as well.

One last comment: if you're interviewing with five people in a row, make sure that you ask EACH of them good questions.  "I've already asked all my questions" doesn't usually come across well.

## Management/Leadership

* What would you say makes a good manager?
* How many meetings do you have, and how evenly is discussion distributed across team members?
* How often do the directives from the executives conflict with doing the best work for your clients?
* Do your executives share regular updates about company progress, company financials, and upcoming changes that impact employees?

## Values

* How good are your staff members at assessing how others are feeling (e.g. upset, left out)?
* How optimistic would you say that the employees here are?
* How do managers make sure that goals are clearly understood?
* Would you say that inside the company, there is a culture of dependability?  

## Team Size/Structure

* How much are you hoping to grow this year?
* What does your on-boarding look like?
* Have you had any trouble maintaining your company culture in the face of growth?
* How many teams does the company have, and how are they organized?
* How often do staff members move across team lines?
